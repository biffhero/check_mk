To use the Azure Monitoring in OMD based installation:

 - Copy the azuremonitor folder to ~/local/lib/python
 - install the azure python api (pip install azure)
 - Copy agent_azure to ~/local/share/check_mk/agents/special/
 - Copy the azure publishsettings file to ~/var/check_mk (you get this file from azure)
 - Copy the checks to ~/local/share/check_mk/checks/
 - Create a datasource program: ~/local/share/check_mk/agents/special/agent_azure ~/var/check_mk/azure.publishsettings
  - Beware, collecting the data may take long time so set another check_interval for your host

 All information will be "piggybacked"
