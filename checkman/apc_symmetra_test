description:
 This check monitors two OIDs of APC Symmetra UPS devices: The result of the last self test
 and the last date of the self test run. The check becomes critical if the test result is
 "failed" and it has a warning or ciritical state if the date of the last self test is more
 than the warning or critical level ago.

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OIDs (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0)
 and if the name of this OID is known to the test. If this is true the system is inventorized.
