description:

 This check monitors the refclock state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting
 the new MBG-LANTIME-NG-MIB. It is only applied to GPS refclocks. Other
 refclocks have their own subcheck.

 The check handles the reported state of the refclock and provides additional information
 about its state, like the number of satellites.

 When the refclock state is "not available" CRIT is raised and a WARN state is issued
 if the refclock state is "not synchronized".
 If the number of good satellites drops below 3, a CRIT state is raised.

inventory:
 One service per GPS refclock is created.

item:
 The index number of the refclock.
