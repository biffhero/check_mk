description:

 This check monitors the number of deferred mails in the outgoing mail
 queue, as sent by the linux agent of Check_MK. Depending on the version
 of the Check_MK agent the number of mails in the active queue is monitored
 as well.

 This check creates one service per host which represents the state
 of the mailqueues.

 The check will result in WARNING/CRITICAL states when the number of items
 in the queues have reached the defined thresholds.

inventory:
 On each system which provides the {postconf} command one service is created.
