It seems more practical to have slightly wider time ranges, e.g. 8 days instead of 7 days
to have a little more context. We also extended the "month" and "year" time ranges.

You have now the following available:

The last 4 hours
The last 25 hours
The last 8 days
The last 35 days
The last 400 days
