Title: notify.py: subprocess p.communicate() calls may block when plugins output a lot
Component: notifcation
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2015-11-19 13:38:58
Targetversion: future

MK: Problem unclear. Is it a problem that a short blocking might occur? Then
that is not the fault of communicate() but of the fact that the execution
of the script may take time.

Seems to be no problem after all.
