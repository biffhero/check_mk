Title: Deleting a context filter should, but does not put it back into the dropdown
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.8

When you edit the Context/Search Filters section of a report, dashboard or
view then for each context type (e.g. services) there is a dropdown where you
can add filters. Added filters are then greyed out in the dropdown. This is OK.

But: If you enter the dialog and there are already filters then these are
not contained in the dropdown - not even grayed out. When you now delete
such a filter you cannot re-add it without saving and coming back.

Fix: Add the already present filters greyed out to the initial drop down.
