If Check_MK agent is removed from systems with apt-get purge check-mk-agent there is an error message:
dpkg: warning: while removing check-mk-agent, directory '/var/lib/check_mk_agent/cache' not empty so not removed

This directory should be removed, because it is only used as cache for the executed plugins.
