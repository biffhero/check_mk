Title: mount check should ignore bind mounts
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: wontfix

Targetversion: 1.2.7

With the new feature extra_sections, the df check should read the
mounts section and do the checking of the mount options here.
By that way we only check real filesystems and no duplicates. Also
this will reduce the number of checks.

Newer versions of df seem to automatically ignore these bind mounts.
At least on Ubuntu 14.04 this works. So in order not to complicate
things we wont do anything here.
