Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: phantasm

Introduce a magic key which is stored in the omd site.
All passwords used by active checks or special agents are scrambled with this key.
We need a mechanism to detect scrambled keys in command lines.
Right before the execution, Check_MK unscrambles the password and executes the active check
or special agent call.
