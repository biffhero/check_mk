Title: Host and Service View with Layout "Matrix" are broken

"Edit View" on a host or service view allows the user to select "Matrix"
as the Basic Layout. This layout however presents the data in a completely
unreadable way, apparently mixing data from different elements into one field
and leaving out most most rows. There is no indication visible to the user
that this layout can't be used in this way.
