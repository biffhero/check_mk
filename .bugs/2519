Title: Input field of hostname is not a regex input field in configuration rules
Component: wato
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

If you create a new rule in WATO for configuration and want to use regex to match hostnames you have to add
the ~(tilde) in front of the hostname to get regex matching.
This inout field should be a regex input field as default.
