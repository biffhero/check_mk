Title: waitmax (32 Bit) und 64 Bit Ubuntu Multiarch segfaults
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: future

Solution could be: use /usr/bin/timeout where available. This should nowadays
always be available. And only fall back to waitmax if missing. This could
be done by an alias in the agent itself.

if which timeout ; then
  alias waitmax='timeout'
fi

Fixed in master. By preferrring timeout over waitmax. In current systems
this is always available. Just RH5 is missing it.
