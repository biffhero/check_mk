Title: Monitoring UP switchports for WARN sometimes breaks
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2016-03-02 13:10:47
Targetversion: 1.2.8

If you setup Interfacemmonitoring (SNMP) in a way that an UP port
will be warned then sometimes the check will not detect this and
stay OK - even in the port UP. Might or might not be due to
counter wraps.

If you restart the OMD site then the problem is gone.

MK: I cannot reproduce this. The code looks OK. Not sure if this
report is really authentic. If it happens again we can easiliy
investigate then....
