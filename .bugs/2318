Title: network interface groups are broken
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: 1.2.8

Seems that the interface grouping feature is not working since the
interface check has been made cluster aware.

An exception "ValueError: need more than 19 values to unpack" is raised for interface group checks.

Should now work. I've not found *that* exception but another one and fixed
it.
