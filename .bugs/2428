Title: Make a clean install of the agents/ directory
Component: core

Targetversion: 1.2.9
Class: bug

The contents of the source code direcgory agents/ in the GIT cannot shipped 1:1
into the Check_MK site anylonger. We need an installation script of the like that
e.g. tars the source codes into nice tarballs, skips internal files and presents
a nice list of files for download on the Agents page in WATO.
