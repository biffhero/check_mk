Title: Deletion of host's state files omitted in certain situations
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2015-12-04 15:37:30
Targetversion: future

If you delete a host via bulk delete, then all files (autochecks, counters,
many other) are being correctly deleted via the automation delete-host. When
you delete a single host or a folder, then this automation is *not* being
called!

Change:

- Call the automation always
- Improve performance by allowing a list of hosts to be specified rather then just one
- Rename the automation in "delete-hosts"
- Write a function that sorts the hosts by their site_ids and call the automation
  once for each affected site.
