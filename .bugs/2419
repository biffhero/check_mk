Title: Missing contact group check-mk-notify when never been in WATO
Component: core
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2016-02-08 15:55:13
Targetversion: 1.2.8

1. Create a new site in the CEE
2. omd config set CORE nagios
3. cmk -R --> missing contact group check-mk-notify

When you now go in WATO (no need for changing something), it works
out. Seems that the default WATO configuration fixes that.

2016-02-16 13:38:21: changed state open -> works4me
I can not reproduce this issue with current 1.2.8/master.
