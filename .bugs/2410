Title: Check_MK HW/SW Inventory fails because var/check_mk/inventory exists
Component: inv
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: 1.2.8

Goes away by itself. Reason seems: race condition. Several checks at the same
time create the directory.

2016-02-07 21:54:28: changed state open -> done
New atomar function ensure_directory() does this now.
