The current concept of services with and without items requires special treatment in various places and causes unnecessary technical issues, i.e. making it impossible to have rules apply to both types of services.
specifying that all checks shall use items - even if they use only one - could get rid of some non-obvious complexity.
To make porting of the configuration and manual configuration easier it could be defined that a missing item will be handled as an empty string for the item name.
Further a parameter for wato rules could be introduced to remove the option to filter by item where this isn't required.
This would probably reduce the amount of code and number of rules without losing functionality.
