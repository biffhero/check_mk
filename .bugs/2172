Title: load_user_file/save_user_file should handle encoding correctly
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: wontfix

Targetversion: 1.2.7

Currently in all saved userfiles unicode strings are converted to utf-8
encoding ascii strings.  These strings are not converted back to unicode
strings during load_user_file(..).  All strings with umlauts need to be
unicode strings within multisite code.

The problem was somewhere else. These functions work like a charm
