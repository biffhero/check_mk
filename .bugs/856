Title: Report scheduler doesn't pass "Group of Host" filter to the report
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2015-12-15 16:20:50
Targetversion: 1.2.8

If you create a Report with context "Hostgroup", add a View with Service
errors, this will work but not when the report is used in the scheduler. If
the scheduler is used, the report shows all systems regradless of the given
hostgroup.
