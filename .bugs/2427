If you create a new custom user macro and assign a value for a user to it.
Then later you convert this macro to "Add as custom macro: [X] Make this
variable available in notifications" then you need to save the user profile
once again in order to make this effective. I assume that it is sufficiant
to save any one user to correctly save all macros.
