If you initiate a page reload on a view by clicking on the page title,
then all static web files are being reloaded. This is not neccessary
and create extensive page requests.

This seems to be the standard behaviour for different situations in most browsers:

a) Entering a new URL in the address bar
b) reloading the page (e.g. F5, ctrl + r)

In case of following a link this the css files are not loaded.

Seems to be ok.
