Title: Cleanup Version: output of special agents
Component: checks

Class: bug

Some special agents use the Version: field of the <<<check_mk>>> section for sending
their e.g. firmware version or something different. But this version is only meant for
Check_MK agent versions. So they should leave the field empty or provide the Check_MK
version.

The special agents which currently have a version should still provide it e.g. in a separate
agent section and have a check for it which at least displays this info.
