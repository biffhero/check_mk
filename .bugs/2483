Title: WATO folder filter does not work in group summary viewss
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2016-04-06 10:13:15
Targetversion: future
Class: bug

The views hostgroups ("Host Groups (Summary)") and svcgroups ("Service
Groups (Summary)") cannot be filtered via the snapin "Folders" or "Tree
of Folders". Reason: the underlying livestatus table is a table of
groups - not of hosts. So no host filters can be applied here. Solution
could be *not* using that table. But then Multisite would need some
stats feature which we currently do not have. Small thing - big issue
to solve....
