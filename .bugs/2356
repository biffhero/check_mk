Title: Improvement for the views: Show timestamp instead of timeperiode
Component: multisite
Class: nastiness
State: closed
Date: 2015-10-08 11:38:41
Targetversion: 1.2.7

Multisite -> Views -> Other will show the last events from the monitoring. The view will
show the timeperiode since the event has occured. If the customers wants to search for
the reason of a problem, the timestamp would be more helpful instead of the timeperiode.
Show the timestamp  in this views.
