Title: Hosts without site attribute are monitored by all sites
Component: core

Class: bug

When creating a host manually or with "hole" script, these hosts have no site attribute set. When this is synced
to a slave site, the host is monitored by both sites.

We should detect that and only monitor those hosts on standalone sites or WATO master sites.
