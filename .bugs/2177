Title: new windows agent: eventlog monitoring should be able to process cleared logfiles
Component: checks

Targetversion: 1.2.8

If someone clears the event log with the event viewer, the windows agent
is unable to start from event log record 0. It insists to continue at 51212, for example.

This report is invalid? Clearing the event log does not reset the event id counter. If your newest record has it 42 and you clear the event console, the next record will still have the id 43. Seeking in the event log is based on that record id so clearing the event log has no effect except that check_mk may miss cleared events it hadn't read yet.
