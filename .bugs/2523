Title: Distributed Monitoring: Not blocked automatic updates for slave sites
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2016-10-25 12:23:06
Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

The user is using a distributed monitoring setup with central WATO configuration.
The slave sites are only monitoring a part of the hosts configured on the master and
the site ID is inherited by the folder properties.

Our normal setup will disable WATO on all slave sites. The problem is, that this will not
disable WebAPI or the direct Multisite URLs. We should block this both ways, too.
Otherwise the user is able to make locale changes, which will be overwritten by the
global configuration on a later time.

Workaround:
Only do those automatic changes on the Master site. Never do it on the slave site.
Take care about, that all of the scripts are using the Master site for those configurations.
