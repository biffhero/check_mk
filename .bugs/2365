Title: generated pnp templates don't support placeholders
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.8

If a template for the new graphing system contains a placeholder
(i.e. %(util:max@count)), that placeholder is resolved fine in new graphs
but not in the generated PNP templates.

Not the full syntax is supported but at least those cases that are in use.
