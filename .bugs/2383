Title: WATO dialog for host creation shows folder contact group attributes
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2015-10-30 10:16:25
Targetversion: 1.2.8

Permissions..

[ ] Everybody
[ ] Gruppe A
[ ] Gruppe B

[ ] Give these groups also permission on all subfolders
[ ] Add these groups as contacts to all hosts in this folder
[ ] Add these groups as contacts in all subfolders

But this was the dialog of a new *host*, not folder.

In *edit*-Mode of a host this is OK and the correct check
boxes are being displayed.
