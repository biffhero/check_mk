Title: Discovery check sometimes does not detect config changes
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-02-09 15:25:38
Targetversion: 1.2.8

After changing a rule like diskstat Discovery mode and doing a rediscovery
every seems fine. But some times later the Check_MK Discovery Check reports
unchecked services. But if you then reschedule the Discovery Service manually,
everything is fine again

2016-04-19 14:20:59: changed state open -> done
Should work now.
