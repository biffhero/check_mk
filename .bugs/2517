Title: Migration from Ubuntu to RedHat with omd backup failed
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

If you create a backup of an existing site with omd backup on a Ubuntu server and do a restore
on a RedHat machine with omd restore, then the site will not be startet. Apache configuration is
wrong, because during the restore the lokale Apache configuration is not reset to system default file.

Workaround:
Replace the include section of modules with default section of another site.
