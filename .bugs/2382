Title: If check files are available in local, we must not read in those in share!

When creating precompiled Nagios files this is already exactly the implemented
behaviour. But when you run cmk -v or CMC then *both* files are being read.
This can lead to a different (wrong) behaviour.

We now read first the files from local. The we skip files already
read.
