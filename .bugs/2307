Title: Automatic removal of duplicate services SNMP vs. Agent can fail
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2015-03-03 10:32:56
Targetversion: 1.2.8

Situtation:

Host is declared TCP + SNMP
Discovery is done -> df and hr_fs checks for the same filesystems
Duplicates are correctly removed

Later the host is redeclared as TCP-only
Checks hr_fs remain in autochecks

get_check_table() now does *not* remove the duplicates since host_is_dual()
does not hold anymore.
Config generation runs into an exception because of duplicate checks.

Proposed resolution: If a is is *not* snmp, get_check_table should
remove *all* SNMP checks. Same holds for TCP.

Note: This does change the semantics a bit but is more clean. A
host cannot try to access an agent anymore if it is not tagged
SNMP or TCP resp.

2016-02-05 14:26:05: changed state open -> done
Removal of duplicates now is also being done for TCP only hosts.
That fixes the immediate problem. The more general solution
is being postponed since its implications to existing installations
are unclear.
