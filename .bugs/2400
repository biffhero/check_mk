Due to a bug in the ReadEventLog function (kb 177199) reading large event logs
may fail. This could be worked around in the agent by using sequential read
and a manual seek to the right offset but we'd have to check the performance
implications.

EventLog code was overhauled and should fall back to sequential reading of event logs if necessary. Unfortunately  wasn't possible to reproduce this problem internally.
