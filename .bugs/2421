Title: GIT mode in WATO ignores changes in subfolders
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2016-02-10 14:34:10
Targetversion: 1.2.8

Reason: invalid conf.d/.gitignore.

Is:
*
!wato
!wato/*

Should be:

*
!wato
!wato/**

Problem: This file is just created once when the feature is enabled.
Wenn need to fix this in existing installations!

Fixed.
