Title: Unicode characters in HTTP variables crash the GUI in different places

When a unicode character is added to URL variables read with html.vars() and this
is added to the HTML output which may already be unicode, this results into an exception.

For example this URL: http://localhost/stable/check_mk/view.py?asdx=asd&view_name=allhosts%F0%9F%98%B4

We should solve this in a general place, for example html.var().
