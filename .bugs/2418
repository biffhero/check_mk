We can now remove the ..._default_levels in the checks because almost no
one uses them in main.mk manually. WATO does not need them. So rather
introduce a new optional key default_params in check_info["foo"] for setting
default params.

If the type of those is dict, then merging takes place and the discovery
function must return a dict as params.

If the type is not dict, then not merging takes place in the discovery
function can return None -> default params are being used, or any other
value -> that is being used.
