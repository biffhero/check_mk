Title: Reschedule Checks only affects some services from the list
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: works4me

Targetversion: 1.2.8

Reschedule active checks like HW/SW Inventory doesn't work at all. If you
have for example 50 Services, only 12 where done.  So you have to do it
multiple times until all checks are triggered.

mk: Maybe this could be the known problem that the CMC ignores all
but the first command if more commands are sent via Livestatus
in one write().

Is probably the same problem as we had. Only first command was
executed.
