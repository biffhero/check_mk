Title: Use language name from .mo or .po?

The .po files contains meta-Data to the translation.  There is a file
"Language: ". Isn't it possible to extract the language alias name from that
instead of keeping this in a separate non-standard file?

It seems to be ok like it is for a long time now. I don't see a huge
benefit to change this.
