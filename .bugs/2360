The "Fake check results" feature on hosts allows to set the status of the host to "up", "down" or "unreachable" but this has no effect, the host status stays as it was.

Works for me. Could be be cause of Smart PING that updates the
state *really* fast.

The core handled check results in a slightly inconsisten way, this has been fixed. Furthermore, the "Fake check results" on hosts GUI has been adapted to reflect the fact that you can't force a host to the "down" state.
