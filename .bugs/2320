Title: Interval configured in "regular service discovery" is handled differently in cores
Component: core
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2015-10-29 16:07:59
Targetversion: 1.2.8

The global settings interval is used only as normal interval on cmc(?) and
e.g. with nagios core this is handled differently.

2016-02-06 21:38:53: changed state open -> works4me
Seems to have been fixed already.
