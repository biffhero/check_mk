Title: On clean sites "X unacknowledged" werks are shown
Component: multisite
State: done

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

In fresh installed sites, all unacknowledged werks in this version need to be acknowledged
right from the start. It is useless to let the user confirm changes when there is nothing
whch has been changed because it is a clean new installation.
