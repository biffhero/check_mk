Title: logwatch: several special characters will break links from logwatch icon
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-12-12 17:21:28
Targetversion: 1.2.7

Brackets and quites and some other characters can be part of logfile names
and thus appear in the paths below var/check_mk/logwatch. In the service
descriptions these characters are removed.  This the icon pointing to the
logwatch GUI does not work. E.g. mk_sap creates such logwatch files.

Solution cannot be renaming the stored logfiles. Better would be, if the
GUI more intelligently can find the actual files.

Should work now. Files are now intelligently been found.
