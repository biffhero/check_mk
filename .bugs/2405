Title: Windows inventory plugin seems to crash with cyrillic symbols in sofware list
Component: checks

Targetversion: 1.2.8

With cyrillic symbols in the software list (manufacturer field) the inventory
plugin crashs and doesn't report remaining sections.  The same probably
applies to other symbols not present in the current code page.

This was a more fundamental problem in how output is piped from scripts to the agent, which failed for all symbols that couldn't be encoded in the current ansi codepage. With commit 091316c the agent can now handle utf16 output (if it contains a BOM) and the inventory plugin now uses that.
