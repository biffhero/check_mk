Title: Distributed Monitoring: Micro Core does need a restart instead of reload to activate the changes
Component: core
State: open
Date: 2016-10-25 12:29:16
Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

The user is using a distributed monitoring setup with central WATO configuration.
The slave sites are only monitoring a part of the hosts configured on the master and
the site ID is inherited by the folder properties.

If the user want to fix his broken configuration, because there were changes made on slave sites, the correct
configuration is only used, if the Micro Core is restartet completly. The normal reload does not work.

Testscenario:
Master and two slave sites. Add some hosts on the Mater site and put add those hosts the the slave sites.
Make some changes on the slave site. Those hosts will be duplicated in the global monitoring. If you
edit the global site settings and make the activation, the hosts does not disappear. Only a cmk -R on the
slave site will fix it. The correct configuration is applied, but will not be actived for monitoring.
