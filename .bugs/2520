If hosts tags are assigned to hosts and you want to remove a specific host tag in mass edit action of hosts,
it will be not removed. The host tag is stiull assigned to the hosts.

Inheritance of folder host tags does not work if you try to remove the host tags.

Workaround:
Please edit single hosts and remove the wrong host tag. This will remove the host tag from the host.
