Title: EC Forwarding: Nagios fails if contactgroup is empty
Component: wato
Class: nastiness
State: wontfix

Targetversion: 1.2.3

The problem is that Check_MK does not create a contact group
if no hosts and services are assigned to it. We could check
if empty contact groups are possible and change that. If we
are in OMD context we could add a patch in Nagios that changes
that and make Check_MK behave like that in OMD context.

For WATO it is not easily possible to savely know wether a 
contact group will be empty, since many aspects are involved
(only_hosts, D-WATO, manual confiugration out of WATO, etc.)

Is not a problem anymore.
