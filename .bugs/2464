Title: Hosts configured for a multisite only site are monitored on master
Component: wato
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

When having the master site connected with another site only in the status world, without
distributed WATO and assigning a host to that site, the host is still monitored by the
master site. The host should simply not be monitored instead.
