Currently the default behaviour of mk_logwatch is to process all input, independent of the amount of data sent and time spent.
Via the "Text logfiles (Linux)" one can set those limits but the default behaviour should already be sane.
In the same Context, there should be an option to not drop exceeding lines but keep them for the next cycle.  
If technically possible it may be desireable to colapse repeated similar lines (i.e. "last line repeated 200 times")
but this would require a reliable way to identify timestamps.
