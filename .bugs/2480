If you change the builtin icon visibility in global settings and want to to reset it,
it is not reset back to the system default. The icons are randomly missing or shown in the
wrong place.

For example: place reschedule in column directly. It is shown correct. After that, if reset to default button is
used, the icons are not shown in the action menu again. It is randomly shown in column or it is missing completly.
