Title: wmic_if: Error messages from parse error go into foreign sections
Component: checks
State: wontfix

Targetversion: future
Class: bug

In some unclear situations wmic_if creates error messages like this:

"Unexpected token 'catch' in expression or statement."
'At C:\\Program Files\\check_mk\\plugins\\wmic_if.ps1:18 char:11'
'+ } catch {}?'
'+           ~'
"Unexpected token '?' in expression or statement."


These messages go into the previous section since the section header
seems not to be output.

--> This plugin is obsolete. The agent now outputs the information itself.
