Title: WATO-Snapshots should warn if data in local/ is too much
Component: wato

Targetversion: 1.2.8
Class: bug

We had the case that a user pu approx 4GB of tmp data below local/.
During "Activate Changes" WATO creates a snapshot of this. This
took very long and lead to a Apache timeout (proxy error...).

We need to validate the data in local/ somehow. Maybe make size
limit? Or positively check all directories?
