Title: User without the permission "Use Check_MK sidebar" has a white bar on the left

If a user logs in who doesn't have the permission "Use Check_MK sidebar", the page is displayed with a huge white bar where the sidebar is supposed to be. This looks hideous. What's more: He also doesn't have a logout button or the button to his profile that would allow him to change his password.
